"The Versatile Tensor Accelerator (VTA) is an open, generic, and "
"customizable deep learning accelerator with a complete TVM-based compiler"
" stack. We designed VTA to expose the most salient and common "
"characteristics of mainstream deep learning accelerators. Together TVM "
"and VTA form an end-to-end hardware-software deep learning system stack "
"that includes hardware design, drivers, a JIT runtime, and an optimizing "
"compiler stack based on TVM."
