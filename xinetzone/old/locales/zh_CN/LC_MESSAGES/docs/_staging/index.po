"Welcome to the documentation for Apache TVM, a deep learning compiler "
"that enables access to high-performance machine learning anywhere for "
"everyone. TVM's diverse community of hardware vendors, compiler engineers"
" and ML researchers work together to build a unified, programmable "
"software stack, that enriches the entire ML technology ecosystem and make"
" it accessible to the wider ML community. TVM empowers users to leverage "
"community-driven ML-based optimizations to push the limits and amplify "
"the reach of their research and development, which in turn raises the "
"collective performance of all ML, while driving its costs down."
