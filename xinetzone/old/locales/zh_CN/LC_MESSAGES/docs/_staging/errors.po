"This error is caused by an internal invariant being violated during TVM's"
" execution. On a technical level, the message is generated by the "
"``ICHECK`` macro, found in ``include/tvm/runtime/logging.h``. The "
"``ICHECK`` macro is used in many places in the TVM code to assert some "
"condition is true during execution; any time the assertion fails, TVM "
"will exit with the error message shown above."
