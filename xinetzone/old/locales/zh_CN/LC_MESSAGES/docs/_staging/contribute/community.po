"TVM adopts the Apache style model and governs by merit. We believe that "
"it is important to create an inclusive community where everyone can use, "
"contribute to, and influence the direction of the project. See "
"`CONTRIBUTORS.md "
"<https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md>`_ for the "
"current list of contributors."

"Everyone in the community is welcomed to send patches, documents, and "
"propose new directions to the project. The key guideline here is to "
"enable everyone in the community to get involved and participate the "
"decision and development.  When major changes are proposed, an RFC should"
" be sent to allow discussion by the community. We encourage public "
"discussion, archivable channels such as issues, discuss forum and "
"mailing-list, so that everyone in the community can participate and "
"review the process later."

"Code reviews are one of the key ways to ensure the quality of the code. "
"High-quality code reviews prevent technical debt for long-term and are "
"crucial to the success of the project. A pull request needs to be "
"reviewed before it gets merged. A committer who has the expertise of the "
"corresponding area would moderate the pull request and the merge the code"
" when it is ready. The corresponding committer could request multiple "
"reviewers who are familiar with the area of the code. We encourage "
"contributors to request code reviews themselves and help review each "
"other's code -- remember everyone is volunteering their time to the "
"community, high-quality code review itself costs as much as the actual "
"code contribution, you could get your code quickly reviewed if you do "
"others the same favor."
