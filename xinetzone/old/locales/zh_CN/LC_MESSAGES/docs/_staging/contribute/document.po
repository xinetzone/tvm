"TVM documentation loosely follows the `formal documentation style "
"described by Divio <https://documentation.divio.com>`_. This system has "

"variety of fields and applications.\""

"These are step by step guides to introduce new users to a project. An "
"introductory tutorial is designed to get a user engaged with the software"
" without necessarily explaining why the software works the way it does. "
"Those explanations can be saved for other document types. An introductory"
" tutorial focuses on a successful first experience. These are the most "
"important docs to turning newcomers into new users and developers. A "
"fully end-to-end tutorial — from installing TVM and supporting ML "
"software, to creating and training a model, to compiling to different "
"architectures — will give a new user the opportunity to use TVM in the "
"most efficient way possible. A tutorial teaches a beginner something they"
" need to know. This is in contrast with a how-to, which is meant to be an"
" answer to a question that a user with some experience would ask."

"optimized model for ARM architecture?\" or \"how do I compile and "
"optimize a TensorFlow model?\" These documents should be open enough that"
" a user could see how to apply it to a new use case. Practical usability "

"How are tutorials different from how-tos? A tutorial is oriented towards "

"helps to on-board and assumes no prior knowledge. A how-to assumes "

"Reference documentation describes how the software is configured and "

"that the audience has a grasp on how the software works and is looking "
"for specific answers to specific questions. Ideally, the reference "
"documentation should have the same structure as the code base and be "

"Architecture Guides are explanations are background material on a topic. "

"decisions, what alternatives were considered, what are the RFCs "
"describing the existing system? This includes academic papers and links "
"to publications relevant to the software. Within these documents you can "
"explore contradictory and conflicting position, and help the reader make "
"sense of how and why the software was built the way it is. It's not the "
"place for how-tos and descriptions on how to accomplish tasks. They "
"instead focus on higher level concepts that help with the understanding "
"of the project. Generally these are written by the architects and "
"developers of the project, but can useful to help both users and "
"developers to have a deeper understanding of why the software works the "
"way it does, and how to contribute to it in ways that are consistent with"
" the underlying design principles."

"The TVM community has some special considerations that require deviation "
"from the simple docs style outlined by Divio. The first consideration is "
"that there is frequently overlap between the user and developer "
"communities. Many projects document the developer and user experience "
"with separate systems, but it is appropriate to consider both in this "
"system, with differentiations where appropriate. As a result the "
"tutorials and how-tos will be divided between \"User Guides\" that focus "
"on the user experience, and \"Developer Guides\" that focus on the "
"developer experience."

"The next consideration is that there are special topics within the TVM "
"community that benefit from additional attention. These topics include, "
