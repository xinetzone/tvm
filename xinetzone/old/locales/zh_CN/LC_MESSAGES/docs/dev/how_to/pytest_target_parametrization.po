"For any supported runtime, TVM should produce numerically correct "
"results.  Therefore, when writing unit tests that validate the numeric "
"output, these unit tests should be run on all supported runtimes.  Since "
"this is a very common use case, TVM has helper functions to parametrize "
"unit tests such that they will run on all targets that are enabled and "
"have a compatible device."

"对于任何支持的运行时，TVM 都应该产生数值正确的结果。"

"The recommended method to run a test on multiple targets is by "
"parametrizing the test.  This can be done explicitly for a fixed list of "
"targets by decorating with ``@tvm.testing.parametrize_targets('target_1',"
" 'target_2', ...)``, and accepting ``target`` or ``dev`` as function "
"arguments.  The function will be run once for each target listed, and the"
" success/failure of each target is reported separately.  If a target "
"cannot be run because it is disabled in the `config.cmake`, or because no"
" appropriate hardware is present, then that target will be reported as "
"skipped."

"For tests that should run correctly on all targets, the decorator can be "
"omitted.  Any test that accepts a ``target`` or ``dev`` argument will "
