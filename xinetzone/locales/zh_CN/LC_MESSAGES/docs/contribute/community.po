"enable everyone in the community to get involved and participate the "
"decision and development.  When major changes are proposed, an RFC should"
" be sent to allow discussion by the community. We encourage public "
"discussion, archivable channels such as issues, discuss forum and "
"mailing-list, so that everyone in the community can participate and "
"review the process later."

"Code reviews are one of the key ways to ensure the quality of the code. "
"High-quality code reviews prevent technical debt for long-term and are "
"crucial to the success of the project. A pull request needs to be "
"reviewed before it gets merged. A committer who has the expertise of the "
"corresponding area would moderate the pull request and the merge the code"
" when it is ready. The corresponding committer could request multiple "
"reviewers who are familiar with the area of the code. We encourage "
"contributors to request code reviews themselves and help review each "
"other's code -- remember everyone is volunteering their time to the "
"community, high-quality code review itself costs as much as the actual "
"code contribution, you could get your code quickly reviewed if you do "
"others the same favor."

"代码评审是确保代码质量的关键方法之一。"
"高质量的代码审查可以防止长期的技术债务，并且对项目的成功至关重要。"
"PR 在合并之前需要被审查。具有相应领域专业知识的提交者将协调 PR，并在代码就绪时合并代码。"
"相应的提交者可以请求多个熟悉代码区域的评审人员。"
"鼓励贡献者自己要求代码评审，并帮助评审彼此的代码——记住，每个人都是自愿为社区贡献时间的，"
"高质量的代码评审本身的成本与实际的代码贡献是一样的，如果你帮助其他人，你的代码也可以很快被评审。"
