"Apache TVM uses the Github (GH) platform for patch submission and code "

" merged into the Apache TVM main tree is composed of the PR's title and "
"body and must be kept updated and reflecting the new changes in the code "

"Although these guidelines apply essentially to the PRs’ title and body "
"messages, because GH auto-generates the PR’s title and body from the "
"commits on a given branch, it’s recommended to follow these guidelines "
"right from the beginning, when preparing commits in general to be "
"submitted to the Apache TVM project. This will ease the creation of a new"
