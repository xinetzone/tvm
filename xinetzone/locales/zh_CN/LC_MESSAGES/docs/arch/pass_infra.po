"Both Relay and TVM IR contain a series of optimization passes which "
"improve performance metrics of models such as mean inference, memory "
"footprint, or power consumption for specific devices. There is a suite of"
" standard optimizations as well as machine learning-specific "
"optimizations including constant folding, dead code elimination, operator"
" layout alteration, operator fusion, buffer handling, and loop "
"transformation, etc. Each of these passes is structured as a ir-to-ir "
"transformation using the analysis result collected during and/or before "
"traversal."
