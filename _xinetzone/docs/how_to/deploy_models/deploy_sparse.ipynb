        "\n",
        "This tutorial demonstrates how to take any pruned model, in this case [PruneBert\n",
        "from Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/huggingface/prunebert-base-uncased-6-finepruned-w-distil-squad),\n",
        "and use TVM to leverage the model's sparsity support to produce real speedups. Although\n",
        "the primary purpose of this tutorial is to realize speedups on already pruned\n",
        "models, it may also be useful to estimate how fast a model would be *if* it were\n",
        "pruned. To this end, we also provide a function that takes an unpruned model and\n",
        "replaces its weights\n",
        "with random and pruned weights at a specified sparsity. This may be a useful\n",
        "feature when trying to decide if a model is worth pruning or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we get into the code, it's useful to discuss sparsity and pruning\n",
        "and dig into the two\n",
        "different types of sparsity: **structured** and **unstructured**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pruning is a technique primarily used to reduce the parameter size of a model\n",
        "by replacing weight values with 0s. Although many methods exist for choosing which\n",
        "weights should be set to 0, the most straight forward is by picking the\n",
        "weights with the smallest value. Typically, weights are pruned to a desired\n",
        "sparsity percentage. For example, a 95% sparse model would have only 5% of\n",
        "its weights non-zero. Pruning to very high sparsities often requires\n",
        "fine-tuning or full retraining as it tends to be a lossy approximation.\n",
        "Although parameter size benefits are quite easy to obtain from a pruned model\n",
        "through simple compression, leveraging sparsity to yield runtime speedups\n",
        "is more complicated.\n",
        "\n",
        "In structured sparsity weights are pruned with the goal of clustering\n",
        "pruned weights together. In other words, they are pruned using both their\n",
        "value and location. The benefit of bunching up pruned weights is that it allows\n",
        "an algorithm such as matrix multiplication to skip entire blocks. It turns out\n",
        "that some degree of *block sparsity* is very important to realizing significant\n",
        "speedups on most hardware available today.\n",
        "This is because when loading memory in most CPUs or GPUs,\n",
        "it doesn't save any work to skip reading a single value at a time, instead an entire\n",
        "chunk or tile is read in and executed using something like vectorized instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unstructured sparse weights are those that are pruned only on the value of\n",

        "a tensor rather than in chunks like we'd see in block sparse weights.\n",
        "At low sparsities, unstructured pruning techniques are difficult to\n",
        "accelerate. However, at high sparsities many blocks of all 0 values\n",
        "will naturally appear, making it possible to accelerate.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial interacts with both structured and unstructured sparsity.\n",
        "Hugging Face's PruneBert model is unstructured but 95% sparse, allowing us\n",
